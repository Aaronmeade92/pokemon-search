# pokemon-search

A React Front-End built using the data provided by the PokeAPI. The user has the ability to search for any and every pokemon. 

When the user uses the search method the app queries the PokeAPI and it returns the name, picture, stats, type and a list of moves that the pokemon is able to learn.

The app in its current state does not utilize Redux as much as I would like but I am always looking to improve it.
